# VersionOne Provisioning for LDAP

The LDAP provisioning tool allows an organization to keep their VersionOne active user list synchronized with users that belong to an LDAP group. The tool assumes that the list of users in the LDAP group is the master list, making updates in VersionOne accordingly. It is built as a standalone exe that can be run as a scheduled task. It polls a configured LDAP directory (active directory and Sun One LDAP have been tested) for users belonging to a configured group, and polls a configured VersionOne instance for a list of users. It compares the users it finds in the LDAP group to the users found in VersionOne and takes appropriate action, according to the chart below. If the Version One instance that is being used is utilizing Version One's internal security, every user that is created or reactivated is emailed a randomly generated password (which is not stored anywhere else other than VersionOne), and instructions on logging in and changing their password. If the instance is using integrated windows authentication, the users will be emailed a notification with instructions where to log in, using their windows system account. Each time the provisioning tool runs, a summary of accounts that were created, reactivated, and deactivated is emailed to the configured administrator address, along with instructions for assigning project access for new users.
